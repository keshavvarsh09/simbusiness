## Or Do It Yourself:

### Step 1: Get Your Repository URL

After creating the repository on GitHub, you'll see a page with setup instructions.

**Look for the URL that looks like:**
```
https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/simbusiness.git
```

### Step 2: Run These Commands

Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` with your actual GitHub username:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/simbusiness.git
git push -u origin main
```

### Step 3: Verify

After pushing, refresh your GitHub repository page - you should see all your files!

## Example:

If your username is `johnsmith`, you would run:

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/johnsmith/simbusiness.git
git push -u origin main
```
