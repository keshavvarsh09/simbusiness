## 🔗 Link Strategy

**All links now use:**
- Main domain URLs (e.g., `https://www.shopify.com/blog` instead of specific article paths)
- Verified stable URLs that won't break
- Default fallback URLs if validation fails

**Examples:**
- ✅ `https://www.reuters.com` (instead of `/business/supply-chain/`)
- ✅ `https://www.shopify.com/blog` (instead of `/blog/specific-article`)
- ✅ `https://www.fedex.com` (instead of `/en-us/shipping/delays.html`)

## 📝 Notes

**Why Main Domains?**
- Main domains are stable and rarely change
- Specific article paths can break when content is moved
- Main domains ensure links always work
- Users can navigate to specific content from main page

**Link Validation:**
- All URLs validated before saving
- Invalid URLs replaced with defaults
- All URLs must start with `http://` or `https://`
