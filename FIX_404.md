# 🔧 Fix 404 Error

## ✅ Custom 404 Page Created

I've added a better 404 page. But let's find out **what URL you're trying to access**.

## 🔍 What URL Are You Accessing?

**Common pages that should work:**
- ✅ `/` - Home page
- ✅ `/dashboard` - Dashboard
- ✅ `/products` - Products
- ✅ `/products/analyze` - Analyze Product
- ✅ `/products/recommendations` - Recommendations
- ✅ `/analytics/meta` - Meta Analytics
- ✅ `/chatbot` - AI Advisor
- ✅ `/missions` - Missions
- ✅ `/bankruptcy` - Risk Check
- ✅ `/auth/signin` - Sign In
- ✅ `/auth/signup` - Sign Up

## 🐛 Possible Issues

### 1. Wrong URL
- Make sure you're using the correct path
- Check the navigation links match the routes

### 2. Not Signed In
- Some pages require authentication
- Try signing in first

### 3. Vercel Build Issue
- Check Vercel deployment logs
- Make sure build completed successfully

## 🧪 Test These URLs

**Try these in order:**
1. `https://simbusiness-nine.vercel.app/` - Should show home page
2. `https://simbusiness-nine.vercel.app/dashboard` - Should show dashboard
3. `https://simbusiness-nine.vercel.app/auth/signin` - Should show sign in

**If home page works but others don't:**
- It's a routing issue
- Check Vercel build logs

**If nothing works:**
- Vercel deployment might have failed
- Check Vercel dashboard
